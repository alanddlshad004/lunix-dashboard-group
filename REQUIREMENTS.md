### Scenarios

#### **Scenario 1 – Personal Expense Tracking**
Rouliana logs into her account and adds her daily expenses such as “Groceries $30” and “Electricity Bill $45.”  
The system automatically categorizes them and updates the dashboard with total expenses for the month.  
A pie chart shows that groceries are **40%** of her spending this week.

---

#### **Scenario 2 – Shared Expense with Friend**
Ammar and Aland go out for dinner. Ammar pays **$40** and logs the bill under “Shared Expenses ⇒ Aland.”  
The system sends Aland a notification that he owes **$20**.  
Once Aland marks it as paid, both dashboards update automatically.

---

#### **Scenario 3 – Group Trip Management**
Zozan creates a “**Trip to UK**” group and adds all members.  
Each person logs their expenses (hotel, fuel, food).  
The system calculates the total cost and shows how much each person owes or should receive to balance the group spending.

---

#### **Scenario 4 – AI Spending Insights**
At the end of the month, the AI module analyzes all transactions and generates a written summary such as:  
> “You spent most on Food (35%) and Travel (25%). Your total expenses increased by 10% compared to last month.”

---

#### **Scenario 5 – AI Summary**
At the end of the month, the system generates financial reports comparing this month’s expenses with last month’s data.  
> “You spent 40% on food and 30% on bills.”

---

#### **Scenario 6 – AI Categorization**
When the user adds an expense (e.g., *10,000 IQD on taxi*),  
the system uses AI to automatically label it under **Transportation** without requiring manual input.  
The user also has an option to override the category if needed.

---

#### **Scenario 7 – Filtering**
Aland filters his transactions by category (e.g., **Transportation**) to check how much he spent on transport within a selected date range.

---

#### **Scenario 8 – Currency Converter**
Zozan pays in **USD** while Rouliana pays in **IQD**.  
The system automatically converts the payment to a unified base currency and updates dashboards accordingly.
