# Identified Risks

1. **AI Expense Categorization and Voice Recording**  
   The AI system might incorrectly categorize expenses or misinterpret voice inputs due to unclear speech or background noise. This could affect the accuracy of reports and user trust in the system.

2. **Real-Time Currency Value Updates**  
   Keeping currency exchange rates up to date can be challenging. Any delay or error in retrieving live values may lead to inaccurate conversions or misleading financial summaries.

# Requirements Validation

To ensure that the listed requirements align with project goals and stakeholder expectations, we conducted reviews and prototype discussions.  
During this process, it became clear that while the AI voice recording feature was an innovative idea, it was not a core requirement for most stakeholders. Users were more focused on accurate expense categorization and a clean, easy-to-use interface.  
As a result, this feature has been moved to future consideration rather than being part of the current release.
